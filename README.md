## :scroll: Description: 
<br>
This is a backend eCommerce app that allows users to use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to adjust their databases.<br>
<br>

## :man_mechanic: Installation:
<br>
To install this app, you must clone the repo into a local file in your machine. You must have Node.js installed in order for this application to work (current version, not most recent). Run 'npm i' within the folder to make sure you have the right dependecies installed for the app to run correctly. Next run 'mysql -u {your mysql username} -p' , enter your password when prompted, and run 'source ./db/schema.sql'. Type in 'quit' to exit out of the MYSQL promts and press enter. When you're back in the terminal, run the command "npm run seed" to generate the seeded database. Then run 'npm start' to initiate the application.

## :book: Usage Info:
<br>
You can use Postman or Insomnia to test your API routes. Simply choose "GET", "POST", "PUT", or "DELETE" within the dropdown box to view, add, update, or delete items in your database.<br>
